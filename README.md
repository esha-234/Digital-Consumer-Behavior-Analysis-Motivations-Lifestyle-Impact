# Digital-Consumer-Behavior-Analysis-Motivations-Lifestyle-Impact

**PROJECT BACKGROUND**

Social media has evolved from simple networking sites into a primary business ecosystem that has even surpassed television. As platforms become integral to how individuals stay informed and validate experiences, understanding the drivers behind high-intensity engagement is critical for market intelligence.

However, while social media offers immense brand opportunities, it also presents complex behavioural risks, including platform dependency and lifestyle impairment. For businesses, these "problematic use" patterns are key indicators of user retention and sentiment. 

This project analyses how social media habits evolve from casual use to high-intensity engagement different age groups. It provides a data-driven framework to group users by their motivations and identifies the factors that disrupt their digital experience.

**METHODOLOGY**

•	**Demographic Reach:** Conducted an end-to-end primary study involving a cross-generational sample of 127 participants (Ages 18–70) with a gender distribution of 59% Male and 41% Female.

•	**Data Instrumentation:** Utilized a multi-section survey instrument capturing demographic profiles, usage frequency, and 18 statements of behavioural impact through a 5-point Likert scale.

•	**Analysis:**

i. Ensured data integrity using Cronbach’s Alpha for internal consistency.

ii.Weights were assigned to the response frequencies (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree), with the highest weight 5, given to the highest frequency, and the lowest weight 1 assigned to the lowest frequency. 

iii. Applied Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to reduce complex data into three primary latent variables: Conflict, Withdrawal, and Tolerance.

iv. Conducted Chi-square testing to identify statistically significant associations between behavioural factors and agreement levels.

v. Calculated the Coefficient of Variation (C.V.) to assess variability in responses and determine the level of consensus among participants. Lower C.V. values indicate lower variability and greater alignment in opinion among respondents.
